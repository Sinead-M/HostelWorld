# HostelWorld

#### Exercise One Comments - 

To run test cd into ExerciseOne module and run "mvn test -Dtxt.Name={txt file name}"
I added some sample txt files in src/main/resources that I was tests against (tests are hard coded to retrieve txt files
 from this
 directory)
 
#### Exercise Two Comments - 

Browser redirected tests to "https://hostelworld.com/pwa/" in consistently which had different element ID's to "https://hostelworld.com". Added if statements to test both flows

#### Exercise Three Comments - 

To run tests cd into ExerciseTwo Module and run "mvn test -Daccess.Token={your access token} -Dgist.Id
={gist Id to delete}"
